This is my winter break 2019 self programming assignment I did for fun. It is an NBA statistics program, where you can
see the current division or conference standings in the league, as well as see player or teams stats with the filters
you want applied. For instance you would like to see how the Toronto Raptors play against the Boston Celtics at home, or
maybe you are curious how Lebron James plays away from home. The program is made up of 7 classes, the Record class keeps
track of wins, losses, and the current streak. The GamePlayer Class keeps track of a certain players stats in a game, similarly
the GameTeam class keeps track of a certain teams stats in a game. The Player class keeps track of a player and their games.
The Team class keeps track of a team, their games and the players who have played for the team that season. Next the League
class is responsible to creating the league from the text files as well as having methods for team and player stats. Lastly,
the interface class contains the main method and is responsible for creating the GUI.

To run the program make sure to include all the .java files, .txt files and the .jpg files. Enjoy!
